# Sudoku Solver

This is a text based sudoku solver. Set up the board in the boardata array. 0 means blank. And it will solve it for you.
This program uses a trial-and-error approach, back tracking when no more possible path. I previously made an Android interface around it so the boardata can be set up in UI.
